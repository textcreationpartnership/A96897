         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Reader, I will cut off the objection by the middle for thy ſake, that thou mayeſt note here with all thy heart this firſt, That it is GODS way and method to ſay Man low, before He raiſeth them; to pluck downe the head, before he will ſet a Crowne upon it; as <hi>David</hi> here, before he muſt be higheſt in the Kingdome, he muſt be the loweſt there. 2. Note alſo, for it will cleere our caſe exceedingly, That indeed <hi>David</hi> now was but a private man, yet he did ſo and ſo, as we ſhall reade preſently: Now let the objection run-on to its full length.</p>
            <p>Object.</p>
            <p>And though a private Man, and at the loweſt, yet ſee how proudly he carrieth himſelfe! Surely he had treaſonable thoughts againſt his Maſter, the LODS anoynted; he that ſcrupeled, at the cutting the lap of his Coate, will not ſcruple at the taking off his Maſters head; he had treaſonable thoughts againſt the LORDS anoynted now: he purpoſed to <hi>Rebell.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No indeed not he; not a thought that way ever came into <hi>Davids</hi> heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But <hi>(no)</hi> anſwers not the queſtion; The caſe is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, <hi>David</hi> had gathered together a great Army.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſame Anſwer muſt ſerve, when all is ſaid, <hi>No; David</hi> did not gather together a great Army; They gathered to him; they came in to him for his guard and reſcue; they were not called-in. The perſecution of <hi>Saul</hi> againſt <hi>David</hi> was very notorious, and at length raiſed the hearts of the people, like a great bell, which being ſet up, made a loud ſound, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led-in for <hi>Davids</hi> helpers; ſo they flocked-in to him, till <hi>his Hoaſt was as the Hoaſt of the LORD</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Chro 12. 22</note>: A ſure token, that <hi>God</hi> was with him too; and that Innocency was in his hand.</p>

            <p>But what doth <hi>Saul</hi> ſay now? Can he call GOD to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord upon his ſoule, That his heart is upright? That he hath a zeale for the <hi>Lords</hi> battels? So he ſaid, can he ſay ſo ſtill? Yet may be he could; but no wiſe-men regarded what he ſaid, when they ſaw <hi>Doeg</hi> was with him, and had made ſuch a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deſtruction. Wiſe-men did obſerve what <hi>Saul</hi> did, and who were his miniſters; and they knew as well as <hi>David</hi> himſelfe, That the perſecution was raiſed againſt the moſt faithfull ſervant in <hi>Sauls</hi> Kingdome; and therefore it was, that who ſo were faithfull in the Kingdome, next to <hi>David,</hi> were ſlain too for his ſake. Now <hi>Saul</hi> might ſpeake, and ſweare and proteſt, and call GOD to witneſſe, it could not be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; his bloudy execution (for it was his, he commanded <hi>Doeg</hi> to fall) upon the Prieſts, and that cruell out-rage againſt <hi>Nob, undeceived</hi> all the people in the Land, and in point of Law. But <hi>Saul</hi> now makes no pretence; he marcheth on now (for he was now entred into blood) <gap reason="foreign">

               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 2.</note> all, and they all hunted <hi>David,</hi> as one hunteth a Partridge in the Mountaines <note n="k" place="margin">Chap. 26. 20.</note>, and once, nay twice they had him in a <hi>coop,</hi> incloſed <note n="l" place="margin">1 Sam 23 26.</note> him in a <hi>Cave</hi> with more then five hundred drawne Swords round about; but the <hi>Lord</hi> gave <hi>David</hi> the day, and the advantage; Truely <hi>Davids</hi> deliverances and reſcues <note place="margin">Chap. 24. 3, 4.</note> were the greateſt miracles that GOD wrought in thoſe dayes.</p>
            <p>But why all this proſecution and perſecution againſt <hi>David?</hi> That is the enquiry: What had <hi>David</hi> done? It was halfe anſwered before, and but the halfe; he had killed <hi>Goliah,</hi> and in him <hi>ten thouſand.</hi> Now we muſt heare the other part; but reade firſt and note it, <hi>David</hi> ſhall have enough urged againſt him; That he conſpired againſt his Maſter <hi>Saul</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">1 Sam. 22. 13.</note>, for <hi>Saul</hi> ſaith, as if he did beleeve, that <hi>David</hi> ſought his <hi>hurt</hi>

               <note n="o" place="margin">Chap. 22. 14.</note>; and <hi>Saul</hi> knew it to be ſo too, though he ſpoke, that <hi>David</hi> conſpired againſt him, and that he ſought his life; they were but fained words, he feared <hi>David</hi> no more, then a dog feares the hare, or a wolfe a lambe: and <hi>Saul</hi> cleares <hi>David</hi> at this point alſo, in his words and in his heart both <note n="p" place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 16, 17, 18. 1 Sam. 26. 21.

But <hi>Saul</hi> conſpired againſt <hi>David</hi> to take away his life, that was viſible, he called all the people together to warre to <hi>beſiege</hi> David, for the reaſon above ſaid, and for this which followes, <hi>Thou ſhalt be King over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and that alſo SA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L</hi> MY FATHER KNOWETH, marke that, and then you have the other part, and are come to the bottome of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>What ever the pretences were, this was the ground of the quarrell; <q>
                  <hi>Sauls</hi> houſe ſhall not be eſtabliſhed; <hi>David</hi> muſt ſucceed, and not <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and <hi>SA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L</hi> KNEW IT.</q> Why then would <hi>Saul</hi> reſiſt, fighting againſt GOD, and a good conſcience? The anſwer is ſhort; becauſe he vvas an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to GOD, and to the good pleaſure of His will; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he endeavours nothing more earneſtly, then to make void the decrees of GOD, though yet they are as the <hi>everlaſting hils</hi> and perpetuall <hi>Mountaines.</hi> Indeed this ever was, and is the great deſigne of the vvorld, What? To dethrone <hi>David,</hi> The <hi>Lord Christ King of Saints:</hi> He ſhall not rule in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the vvorld; not over them; they ſtill ſaid ſo, and ſo they ſay ſtill; ſo they ſet themſelves, taking counſell together, ſtill againſt the <hi>LORD,</hi> and againſt His ANNOINTED.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>David</hi> had done vvorthily for the people of <hi>God,</hi> in one Adverſary he had ſlain ten thouſand.</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:110998:10"/> ſhould not be King then: Thence roſe the quarrell, and it has continued ever ſince upward to this day.

And yet, if we aske theſe men, they will anſwer in coole blood, That the LORD CHRIST doth raigne, and muſt raigne; He will take to <hi>Himſelfe Power, be the Nations never ſo angry:</hi> Notwithſtanding, what they thinke in coole-blood, thus they <note place="margin">Rev. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17, 18</note> doe in their Anger; <hi>They breake His bands in ſunder, and caſt away His cords from them.</hi> This is the ground of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, the <hi>dethroning</hi> of the LORD CHRIST; as this has, <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 3.</note> ſo it will cauſe the bloudieſt warre, that ever was read of in the world.

            <p>Now to the maine buſineſſe, 1. To vindicate <hi>David</hi> and his <hi>hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> from doing wrong or injuſtice againſt <hi>Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Then I ſhall cleare <hi>Davids</hi> compaſſion to <hi>Saul,</hi> and to his owne ſoule; All this in ſtanding upon his guard, and defending himſelf.</p>
            <p>1. The firſt is as cleare as the Sunne-ſhine, <hi>David</hi> tooke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from <hi>Saul,</hi> but added to him, he would have maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Ziglag</hi> for him; All <hi>Davids</hi> deſignes were to ſafeguard <hi>Sauls</hi> life; and ſtill his in-rodes were upon <hi>Sauls</hi> Adverſaries; All his wayes were not alwayes warrantable there; then hee wandred erring from the way, when feare ſurpriſed him, and that was more then once; but not once in all his life, did he doe the leaſt hurt to <hi>Saul,</hi> but much good ſervice.</p>
            <p>Obiect.</p>
            <p>By your leave, <hi>David</hi> might have hurt <hi>Saul,</hi> and have ſlaine him too: For, had not the <hi>LORD</hi> told <hi>David,</hi> that the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 23. 10, 11.</note>, notwithſtanding their engagements to <hi>David,</hi> yet would deale treacherouſly with him, he had ſtood upon his guard there, and fortified the Towne, and maintained it againſt <hi>Saul;</hi> who, ſo glad of that advantage, and calling together all the people to befiege <note n="b" place="margin">ver. 9.</note> 
               <hi>David,</hi> might have endangered his life there, that he might.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes indeed might he; No doubt but <hi>Saul</hi> would have made a furious on-ſet upon <hi>Keilah</hi> for <hi>Davids</hi> ſake, (it was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110998:10"/> as ſome Towne our thoughts may be upon, well fortified, and had <hi>gates and barres,)</hi> for he was the very <hi>But</hi> and <hi>white</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at malice ſhot all her Arrowes; and if the <hi>Keilites</hi> had been faithfull to <hi>David,</hi> he would not have been treacherous to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and then in the heat of the battell, and hot charge againſt <hi>David,</hi> he could not teach the arrows, or what other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of death they had, to make difference betwixt <hi>Saul</hi> and a common Man. <hi>Saul</hi> might have forborne, and have taken leiſure enough to looke to himſelf, <hi>David</hi> had work enough, to prevent <hi>Saul,</hi> and to ſave his owne throat. If <hi>Saul</hi> will runne upon the Sword, who can ſtay him? It is all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that needs to a queſtion but ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing we are upon that Chapter, let us obſerve the bold confidence of the man; <hi>David</hi> is come to <hi>Keilah</hi> ſayes he; he is ſhut in there, by entring into a Towne that hath <hi>gates and barres</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">ver. 7.</note>. Well, what if he be? There is a <hi>POWER</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> that can breake Gates of braſſe and barrs of Iron. But obſerve, I ſay, how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confident the man is, and yet how miſtaken! He is ſure enough now, ſayes <hi>Saul,</hi> I have him now faſt enough: <hi>GOD hath delivered him into my hand.</hi> Look ye! <hi>Saul</hi> thought that GOD <hi>ſhined</hi> upon His bloudy counſels: (indeed the <hi>LORD</hi> gives ſome ſucceſſe that way, that the counſell of the wicked may be carried head-long) when as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed GOD went cleane croſſe unto him, and declared His <hi>Name</hi> to be <hi>Wonderfull</hi> for <hi>David;</hi> onely the <hi>LORD</hi> gave <hi>Saul</hi> this advantage to manifeſt the ſpirit of the man, and to diſcover the treachery of the people, that was it. But <hi>Saul</hi> underſtood none of all this, he thought, as was ſaid, that <hi>GOD</hi> bleſſed His indeavours, proſpered his deſigne, though it was the perſecution of <hi>David, throughout all the thouſands of</hi> Judah <note n="d" place="margin">1 Sam. 23. 23.</note>.</p>
            <p>How came <hi>Saul</hi> to be ſo blinded in an evill way? Say hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and brawned too; Then looke in the Chapter immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before; and that will give you anſwer to both <note n="e" place="margin">1 Sam. 22.</note>. <hi>Saul</hi> had taken a bloudy <hi>Edomite</hi> to his ſide; had ruſhed furiouſly into a Towne of Prieſts, and we have read what a ſlaughter he made there. He waſhed his feet in the blood of the <hi>Lords</hi> chiefe ſervants; he muſt needs be blinded now and brawned in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:110998:11"/> way. This in paſſage: But I thinke I have cleared this, which was the firſt: <q>That neither <hi>David,</hi> nor his <hi>helpers</hi> did any wrong to <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </q> I come now to the ſecond thing, which is the chiefe of my undertaking; <q>That <hi>David</hi> in ſeeking to defend and ſafeguard himſelf, did ſhow compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Saul,</hi> even to the life of his life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Sauls</hi> underſtanding was now ſo clouded, the light which was in him, was overſpread with ſuch a thicke darkneſſe, that he accounted the delivering up <hi>David</hi> into his hands (which the people, ſo brutiſh and vile they were, ſo blind alſo, they followed <hi>Saul</hi> up to the knees in bloud; and ſuch enemies to their Kings peace, were ready to doe) ſo as he might ſheath his ſword in <hi>Davids</hi> bowels, even this, <hi>To be a mercy to his ſoule, Bleſſed be ye of the</hi> Lord, <hi>for yee have compaſſion on me</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">1 Sam. 23. 21.</note>: See there, <hi>Saul</hi> bleſſeth murtherers, whom <hi>GOD</hi> curſeth, and he ſhould have put to death. And he accounts it a <hi>COMPASSION</hi> to his ſoule. What? To have the opportunity given him for the taking away <hi>Davids</hi> life. Lay this together, conſider on it, then we muſt conclude, that <hi>David,</hi> in ſtanding upon his guard, and admitting ſuch helpers, which <hi>GOD</hi> ſent-in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, did ſhow compaſſion even to his Maſters ſoule: As he did to his own ſoul, in reſcuing that by all faire means out of the hands of a murtherer. I ſaid, compaſſion to his Maſters ſoul; That is compaſſion indeed, to keepe a man from ſhedding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood. That reſtraint is a bleſſed reſtraint, which keeps the foote from the path of the deſtroyer: That counſell, bleſſed counſell, which checks and ſtopps a man in the purſuance of bloody deſignes. We may ſay of ſuch reſtraints, and of ſuch counſellours, as we weade; <q>Bleſſed be the LORD GOD of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and bleſſed be the advice; and bleſſed be thoſe counſellours, who would keepe this day <hi>from ſhedding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 25. 32, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>blood.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We will looke over this once more that we may obſerve in paſſage thence, and ſtand humbled at our obſervation; firſt;</p>
            <p n="1">1. What a thick cloud man hath caſt over his underſtanding! What does <hi>Saul</hi> call <hi>a compaſſion on him?</hi> The delivering up of <hi>David</hi> into his hands, that ſo he might ſheath his Sword in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:110998:11"/> his bowells: And now that the <hi>Ziphites</hi> will (after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) doe <hi>Saul</hi> this kindneſſe to deale <hi>treacherouſly</hi> with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">ver 19.</note> aand betray innocent blood, <hi>Saul</hi> will bleſſe them in the Name of the LORD. Truely here is a ſtrange compaſſion, and as ſtrange a bleſſing, yet not ſtrange from <hi>Saul,</hi> a ſtranger to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and has made ſuch a ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and committed ſuch an out-rage upon <hi>Nob,</hi> for that muſt be remembred ſtill all along,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Compare we the compaſſion the <hi>Ziphites</hi> would have ſhewne to <hi>Saul,</hi> with the compaſſion <hi>David</hi> did ſhew unto him <note n="d" place="margin">1 Sam. 24. Chap. 26,</note>, Then we ſhall ſee plainly, that the <hi>Ziphites</hi> compaſſion was trencherous and bloody, they can ſhew no compaſſion; But <hi>David</hi> can; his compaſſion is compaſſion indeed, mercy to the Body, and to the Soul alſo. All this <hi>David</hi> ſhewed to <hi>Saul.</hi> Now in the next place, we muſt give <hi>David</hi> leave to ſhew,</p>
            <p>2. Compaſſion to his owne Soule; ſo I ſaid; And is not the ſoule worthy whereto a man ſhould ſhew compaſſion? Why ſhould a man ſuffer the thred of life to be cut, his ſoule to be let-out by a bloody hand, which no ſooner is let-out, but it lancet forth into the deepes of eternity, where it muſt live for ever? Why ſhould a man neglect his life, his pretious life, which is given him here, to make proviſion for a happy life hereafter. We have heard what <hi>David</hi> a private man did, for his Maſter <hi>Saul,</hi> and for himſelfe, how juſt and innocent in all; now heare him out, what he ſaith; <q>If you be come peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably unto me, mine heart ſhall be knit unto you, but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, ſeeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the GOD of our Fathers looke thereon and rebuke it.</q> In the next place, heare what <hi>Abigall</hi> ſaith; <hi>The LORD will certainely make my Lord a ſure houſe</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 25 28.</note> How <note place="margin">a Chro. 12. 17.</note> knowes ſhe that? <hi>Becauſe my Lord fighteth the Battels of the LORD.</hi> What Battels were they? Offenſive againſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> defenſive againſt <hi>Saul. And evill hath not found in thee all thy dayes: Yet a man is riſen to purſue thee, and to ſeeke thy ſoule.</hi> Who was that? <hi>Saul; But the ſoule of my Lord ſhall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy GOD, and the ſoule of thine enemies, them ſhall He ſling out as out of the midſt of a ſling.</hi> She was no Propheteſſe, but it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110998:12"/> was juſt as ſhe ſaid. In the laſt place, heare what <hi>Amaſai</hi> ſaith, for he ſpake by the <hi>Spirit;</hi> 
               <q>Then the Spirit came upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſai,</hi> who was chiefe of the Captaines, and he ſaid, Thine are we <hi>David,</hi> and on thy ſide, thou Sonne of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers, for thy GOD helpeth thee. Then <hi>David</hi> received them, and made them Captaines of the band, <hi>David</hi> might receive thoſe helpers,</q> and employ them, for they came unto him with a bleſſing from GODS Mouth, and with a Warrant from His Hand. And ſo the ſacred Scripture hath cleared <hi>Davids Militia</hi> to be loyall and lawfull.</p>
            <p>The ſame <hi>Oracle</hi> ſayes as much, and more in the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>Militia,</hi> raiſed for the <hi>Defence of our Lord the King, his Crowne and Dignity:</hi> The Malignant Party will interrupt me here; they and they only are a WALL to the King, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Kingdome <hi>by night and day</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 19.</note> So they ſay, and you may beleeve them. Now what ſhall I ſay? That our <hi>Militia</hi> (I call it ours, becauſe our Lawes, Liberties, Lives, the life of our lives, Religion and all, are concerned in it) is raiſed for the <hi>offence</hi> of the Kingdome, to open the doores and frontiers thereof, that the Beaſts of prey may enter-in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; to make the Nation <hi>the portion of Foxes.</hi> I may ſay ſo if I will, but no ſober man will think me ſober for ſaying ſo; Therefore I will ſpeake-out my words, That the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays as much, and much more in juſtification of our <hi>Militia,</hi> raiſed for the <hi>fortifying</hi> the <hi>Kingdome</hi> (the King alſo, for what is good for the one; is good for the other: As what is good for the <hi>Bee-hive</hi> is alſo good for the <hi>Bee)</hi> That it may be a WALL <hi>about the Kingdome indeed by night and day;</hi> for the ſafe-guarding of All we count good there, <hi>his Majeſties Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Crowne, and Dignities; our Lawes and Liberties, and the life of all, our Religion;</hi> This great Buſineſſe is managed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cleare <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of GOD, that His <hi>Glory,</hi> and the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Land, ſhould be maintained with all that we count deareſt unto us, our deareſt blood, in reſiſting thoſe, who doe oppoſe that <hi>Glory,</hi> and would ſpoile us of ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteemable a jewell; It is pure obedience in this caſe, and for thoſe in Authority, to bring, forth the Sword, and Speare, ſo

               <hi>raſe it even to the foundation thereof,</hi> which may awaken the Nation, and ſtirre them up to defend themſelves, and avenge themſelves of ſuch Adverſaries. But I forbeare, ſuppoſing the Readers judgement (if he is not willingly ignorant) cleared in this matter, by thoſe many cleare Treatiſes in every mans hand, which doe fully ſtate the buſines, and make full anſwer to the cavils againſt it. I goe-on now where I left; I have cleared the juſtice of <hi>Davids Militia;</hi> now it is objected, The juſtice of ours is not ſo cleare.</p>
            <p>Object.</p>
            <p>What is all this to juſtifie the <hi>Militia</hi> now on foote?

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To anſwer the laſt firſt, It is cleare in the Chapter, That, to the 23. verſe, thoſe are numbred, who came-up to <hi>David,</hi> to defend and ſafe-guard him, againſt the malitious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of <hi>Saul</hi> and his bloody ſervants, who ſought by <hi>force</hi> and <hi>fraud,</hi> to take away his life. Paſt all queſtion, that was the end, and tendency in coming to <hi>David</hi> in Troopes; and not to pick <hi>Cockleſhels,</hi> as, I reade a great Hoaſt was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to doe, to ſhew, I think, the authority and force of their <hi>Generalls</hi> command: They came for the purpoſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, there is no doubt of that; And yet the Scripture is ſilent in what they did for <hi>David:</hi> very little ſure, but ſtanding-on his ſide, and making ſuch an appearance for him, it muſt needs ſtrike ſome terrour into his Adverſaries; It is more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable alſo, That <hi>Saul</hi> at this time, obſerved the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering ſtrength againe, and they were Enemies indeed, which might take him-off from purſuing <hi>David:</hi> for ſure this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110998:13"/> on <hi>Davids</hi> ſide, was neare the time of <hi>Sauls</hi> death, and <hi>Davids</hi> coming to the Throne.</p>
            <p>But this I would have noted in our paſſage here, That, as we reade not here of any deliverance, that <hi>God</hi> wrought for <hi>David</hi> by this great Hoaſt: So ſhall we never reade, that <hi>God</hi> wrought any greate deliverance for His Church by great Hoaſts at any time: No? What ſay you to the Yeare 88? I ſay it is our weakeneſſe, I might ſay our wickedneſſe, to give the glory of that deliverance, as we doe, to our great Hoaſt; The LORD fought againſt that <hi>Siſera,</hi> as won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully then, as, in ancient dayes, Hee did, <hi>when the Starres in their courſes fought againſt him</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Judg. 5. 20.</note>. And ſo He ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, not the ſhips only, but <hi>the bones of them that encamped againſt us.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> put an hooke into the noſe of that inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Adverſary, as once He did into the noſe of him (ſo like a Beaſt) and turned him backe not by the way <note n="g" place="margin">2 Kin. 19 28.</note>, <hi>which he came forth;</hi> but ſo, that he, who came out againſt His Church <hi>one way, did flie before Her ſeven wayes</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 28. 7.</note>. Thus the LORD did, that He might be magnified and have all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I might be large here and to excellent purpoſe, but then, I ſhould digreſſe from the buſineſſe in hand; only let me ſay this, That GOD wrought then for <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> was alone, skipping from this place unto that, now from this hole into another, when <hi>Saul</hi> would ſearch him out <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Thouſands of</hi> Judah: Then the LORD wrought gloriouſly for <hi>David,</hi> and then <hi>David</hi> could ſee the <hi>Bare-ARME</hi> of the LORD in his deliverance, which he not ſeene if the <hi>LORD</hi> had done it by his great Hoaſt. This is <note place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, As little as might be, as he will doe, that ſhifts for his life; his worke was to ſave one, and then hee ſaved all, and that hee might doe, and not make much a doe, or much ſtirre in the Land.

                  <p>David <hi>is delivered out of the ſtraits, and enlarged. Before hee ſate downe in his Throne, he does Juſtice, ſhedding the blood of the Murtherer. He ſets his heart and hope in GOD; therefore he had dominion over the mighty. His care is about the Arke; GOD careth for him: He does his duty, that is mans worke; GOD ſafeguards him; makes proviſion for him; that is GODS worke.

               <p>There comes a man to him <hi>out of the Campe</hi> from <hi>Saul,</hi> like a mourner, but with joyfull news in his mouth (he thought) for though he muſt tell <hi>David,</hi> That the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were many of them <hi>fled,</hi> and many <hi>fallen;</hi> and many <hi>dead,</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> dead alſo: yet this would make amends for all, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <hi>David,</hi> even over the death of <hi>Jonathan;</hi> and <hi>Saul is dead alſo</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> queſtions the man, and the man is as ready in his anſwer, aſſuring <hi>David</hi> concerning the truth of the whole matter; but cleares this, which he thought would be moſt welcome, and ſweeten all the bitterneſſe in <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſlaughter, and <hi>Jonathans</hi> death, <hi>That</hi> Saul <hi>is dead alſo;</hi> I am ſure of that

               <p>This ſounds very ill in <hi>Davids</hi> eare; he is not glad to heare <hi>his Enemie was fallen;</hi> No, though he ſtood betwixt him and a Crowne: <hi>David</hi> does, as a man, that cannot ſee matter of joy, no not in being ſet-up, and chief in the Kingdom, When <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſet under: <hi>Iſrael</hi> mournes, he mournes alſo; and as the <hi>Maſter,</hi> ſo all the <hi>Servants</hi> do, <hi>likewiſe all the men that were with him</hi>

He tels him, That he is <hi>the ſonne of a ſtranger, an</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekite <note n="c" place="margin">ver. 13.</note>. The very ſame; his actions told <hi>David</hi> as much before; he ſhall have the reward of an <hi>Amalekite; he deſtroyed Saul</hi> (his own confeſſion was ſo) he was not afraid <hi>to ſtretch his hand againſt the</hi> LORDS <hi>annoynted;</hi> The hand of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhall be now ſtretched out againſt him (ſince it was not ſtretched out before, when <hi>GOD</hi> commanded <note n="g" place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 3.</note>) to cut him off from the Earth. The Crowne of an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> is tendred by the hand of an <hi>Amalekite</hi> unto <hi>David;</hi> he looked upon it with diſdaine; and his head ſhall be taken from his ſhoulders, becauſe he was ſo bold to take an <hi>Iſraelites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Crown into his hands.</p>
               <p>It was a cuſtome (it may be it continues ſtill) That at <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne times,</hi> when the Crowne is ſetting upon the head, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners are looſed; the <hi>Jewes</hi> had ſuch a cuſtome on the day of their <hi>Feaſt</hi>

               <p>Truly, I know not well what to ſay next, but Idols and their abominable ſervices, will darken all this glory; for thus it was; <hi>Solomon</hi> was the greateſt example of Wiſdome, Riches and Honour, that ever was in the world: and the ſtrangeſt example of humane frailty, that ever we reade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> off, being ſo wiſe a man. But what is man in his beſt eſtate, though the wiſeſt and the ſtrongeſt? Not <hi>Subſtantive</hi> enough to ſtand of himſelfe, nor wiſe enough to order his ſteps. If the LORD, Who is our ſtrength and our wiſdome, with-draw His hand, we fall, and poſſibly ſo low, that he, who was a mirrour of wiſdome even now, becomes anon the mirrour of folly. <hi>Hold me</hi> Lord, <hi>and I will hold Thee,</hi> ſaid a good woman, who ſaw how weake ſhe was in her ſelf, and how ſtrong ſhe might be in her <hi>GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

How the <hi>LORD</hi> met with him is remarkable allſo, which I paſſe-over, touching onely upon it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>
               <p>Concerning his <hi>fall</hi> and recovery againe, there is pregnant proofe in ſacred Writings; and no matter what fooles ſay, though they write books about it, no wiſer at the end, then at the beginning. True it is, though <hi>Solomon</hi> was really ſo wiſe, ſo rich, ſo honourable, yet, when he A WOKE (for I allude to it) when he came to himſelf, behold it WAS A DREAM <note n="o" place="margin">1 King. 3. 15.</note>, his wiſdome, his riches, his worldly power, <hi>Behold!</hi> It <hi>is a dreame, Vanity of vanities all is vanity;</hi> ſo ſaid he, who <hi>haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to find ſatisfaction; who more then he?</hi>

               <p>That little more, which concernes our preſent Theame, is this; <hi>Solomon</hi> was a King of Peace, and enjoyed long peace, he and his people; Judah <hi>and</hi> Iſrael <hi>were many as the ſand, which is by the Sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry</hi>

               <p n="1">1. He will not abide reproofe; That was a great <hi>infirmity,</hi>

               <p n="2">2.

What ſhall we doe with all theſe, for here are many infirmities?</p>
               <p>We muſt learne hereby how to judge of others; and to make uſe of their infirmities, ſo as to ſtrengthen us againſt our owne. If we judge at all it muſt be by the rule, obſerving the beſt actions <note n="*" place="margin">See Childs portion, <hi>p.</hi> 94.</note> that we can ſee in men, and judge not by their ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and inconſiderate wayes, but by the <hi>courſe</hi> of a mans life, and according to the more conſtant way and frame of his ſpirit. And here we may obſerve a great variety, and change in the wayes and actions of good men, as here in <hi>Aſa;</hi> In the 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> he does that, which <hi>is right in the eyes of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>commands Iſrael</hi> ſo to doe: and then he beares-up himſelfe <note place="margin">See <hi>Iob</hi> in his ſecond Chapter, then looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in the third.</note> in the Hand and Power of GOD, and do's wonders.

In the 15. <hi>Chap.</hi> he is hearkening to the good Prophet, and very attentive to his words, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

Chapter, he is wrath with the <hi>Seer,</hi> puts him into priſon, and oppreſſeth the people. It is a reſolved caſe; Man is not <hi>Subſtantive</hi> enough to ſtand alone; if GOD leaves Him, he fals, but that was noted before. We will note this here, That the inward-man, the inward frame of ſpirit is ſubject to as many changes, as the outward man; nay, it is expoſed to more invaſions, and greater incurſions, whereby to unſettle it, and put it out of frame, then is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, the outward frame of body: which conſideration, if laid to heart, teacheth us firſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To walke <hi>ſoftly</hi> all our days, and <hi>humbly</hi> before our <hi>God;</hi> To fixe our ſelves upon His Arme, and ſtay our ſelves there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; To ſay, as we heard before: <q>Hold me, <hi>LORD,</hi> els I cannot hold Thee: if Thou takeſt me not by the hand, to hold me there, I ſhall ſlip, perhaps fall too, I know not how low.</q> And</p>

And thus we have learnt to judge of others infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to make uſe of them to our ſelves. Now we muſt find out a cover for all this, and, bleſſed be GOD it is found out to our hands. Bleſſed be God the Father of our LORD JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, there is a <hi>Garment</hi> pure enough and large enough to cover all theſe infirmities, and <hi>heale all thy diſeaſes;</hi>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:110998:42"/> taken no care, that the people might be taught in the Law of their <hi>GOD:</hi> And bleſſings be upon the ſoules of them, who, ſeeing the miſchiefe of ignorance, what thoſe people are, that are an untaught people, make it their prime and chiefe worke (after the caſting-out of Idolls) To provide for a poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nuzzled in ignorance, that they may be taught in the Law of their <hi>GOD</hi> through all the Cities of <hi>Judah.</hi> This was <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphats</hi> care; he will have his Prieſts and Levites, all doe their worke, which becomes them, belongs properly to them, to keepe the <hi>Charge</hi> of the LORD, <hi>Teaching the people the Law of GOD,</hi> throughout all the Cities of <hi>Judah.</hi> Theſe two Concluſions doe naturally follow from theſe premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:110998:42"/> care, and how he proſecutes it we ſhall ſee hereafter.

               <p>Touching the juſtice of this warre, there was little or no queſtion to be made: for <hi>Benhadad,</hi> who owed <hi>Ahab</hi> his life, breakes one Article of the League, in with-holding <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth Gilead</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> is jealous of theſe 400. Prophets, (too many to be good) and would preferre an honeſt mans judgement, eſpecially in point of <hi>warre,</hi> before them all; <hi>Is there not here a Prophet of the LORD beſides, that we might enquire of him?</hi> Yes, ſaid <hi>Ahab,</hi> there is one man more, but I HATE him.

I will anſwer that; Becauſe he was an honeſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and would ſpeake the <hi>Truth,</hi> and that is alwayes <hi>evill</hi> to an <hi>evill heart.</hi> But yet <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> prevailes, and the man is ſent for by a meſſenger ſent from <hi>Ahab,</hi> who muſt leſſon the good man before he come (as ſome have beene taught what to ſay from Mans mouth when they were to ſpeake from GODS Mouth) and put words into his mouth <note n="e" place="margin">ver. 12.</note>; <q>Behold, ſaith he, one Prophet hath taken to himſelf <hi>hornes of Iron,</hi> and has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Kings enemies already in a phancy <note n="f" place="margin">ver. 10.</note>, and all the other Prophets are of the ſame mind, and lippe too, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, It ſhall be proſperous; They ſay to <hi>Ahab goe up and prosper:</hi> And thou muſt frame thy mouth, when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt unto the King, to ſay ſo too; <hi>goe up and prosper.</hi>
                  </q> No but I will not, ſaid the good man; Does thy Maſter pretend to enquire of the <hi>LORD,</hi> and doſt thou tell me what I muſt ſay: And <hi>Micaiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>As the LORD liveth, even what my GOD ſaith that will I ſpeake.</hi> A good reſolution, and but becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">ver. 6.</note> a Prophet of <hi>GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the good Prophet is with the bad King, and the <note place="margin">ver. 13.</note> firſt words he ſayes are ironicall, which make the ſtrongeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall by affirming, (which the King does not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;) But ſee his hypocriſie I he ſeemes eager to heare the

               <p>Now this had beene a wonder to the reader, that <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> notwithſtanding all this, went-up with <hi>Ahab</hi> to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, but that we finde him joyned in affinity with <hi>Ahab;</hi> gone downe to <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> and at a feaſt with him.

For they were upon the ſervice of the <hi>Lord;</hi> Their hearts were taken with it; here was <hi>Paſſ time</hi> indeed; for in an holy mirth, as well as in a Calviſh brutiſh Mirth, time paſſeth away and is gone before we are aware; O it is all in all, when a man feeles a reliſh, a delight and ſweet contentment in the ſervice of the <hi>Lord</hi> (as he doe's, that is targht <hi>The good knowledge of the</hi> LORD) he is as merry in his ſervice before the <hi>Lord,</hi> as we are when we have our min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrell with us, and are dancing and skipping after our meaſures, and manner of <hi>Heathen</hi> people before a <hi>May-pole,</hi> there learning the knowledge of warre, by ſuch feats of Activity as are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>May-games</hi> (for ſo much I have learnt by reading) That ſuch ſports will make us fit for warre; and is it not even ſo!

Our ſporting with the <hi>Lord,</hi> has made us fit for warre indeed, to be conſumed by the Sword of the Almighty; And truly, though I am no Prophet, I feared all this more then 7 years ago.</p>
               <p>I have not forgot my ſelfe all this while, I know where I am, though out of my way a little: Nor doe I forget how much I was miſtaken a little before, where I compared the mirth of that man, who delights himſelfe in the <hi>good know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the LORD,</hi> in ſervice done to His Name, where I

(I expreſſe my ſelfe, as well as I can) We in our warrlike exerciſes have paſſed away the time, we know not how: The Holy day (we <hi>will</hi> call it ſo, for whether it <hi>be</hi> the <hi>LORDS DAY (Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeed)</hi> or <hi>Saints</hi> dayes in our conceit, all one to us, to Whom that Day is moſt holy, whereon we may be moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane) The holy Day is too ſhort, we wiſh it longer, and that every Sunday had it's <hi>ſeconds</hi> (ſo one expreſſeth it) as two <hi>Sundayes</hi> have (now my mind is upon their ſports, I will name dayes, as the Heathen did) <hi>Red-Letter-Dayes</hi> are as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to us, as to children; we may riot on them, and they may play.

               <p>They had continued ſeven dayes at their <hi>Feaſt</hi> in their holy mirth, <hi>Offering Peace-offerings, and making Confeſſion to the LORD <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>GOD of their Fathers</hi> (the more hearty the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, the more hearty their mirth: As the ſowrer the Herbs, the ſweeter the Paſſeover) And now thoſe dayes were over.</p>

And it muſt be ſo, for this reaſon; While the heart is altogether carnall, it let's forth, and ſpends it's ſpirits upon prophane things: Anſwerably, as a ſpirituall heart let's forth it ſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards holy things. But here is a wide difference againe, our mirth is of no continuance, it ends with the day, when we ſhut-in our doores at night, we ſhut forth our mirth for the moſt part; and if death, or ſomething like it, ſhould ſtare us in the face, the night after we have bin ſo merry after our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: where is our mirth then?

I have not been too long upon this point, but though <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> breake-off, the ſacred Text carries it on further, for behold nothing but joy and gladneſſe and bleſſings, never the like ſince the time of <hi>Solomon;</hi> There were mighty Prayers too, full of ſpirit and life, <hi>Their Prayer came-up to His holy Dwelling place, even unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>

               <p>That was ſpoken before, but we will reade it againe: for me thinkes the words runne like a <hi>whirle-wind</hi> or a <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> ſo carrying Idolls and Images downe before it, and ſcattering them; he <hi>brake</hi> the Images in peeces, <hi>cut-downe</hi> the <hi>Groaves; threw-downe</hi> the <hi>High-places</hi> and the <hi>Altars,</hi> out of all <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> in <hi>Ephraim</hi> alſo and <hi>Manaſſeh.</hi> How long was he upon that worke? <hi>

               </p>
               <p>The King cares for none of all this, nor his rage, nor his blaſphemy, for there was nothing in ſight now ſtanding, to offend the eye of his <hi>GOD; Hezekiah</hi> had deſtroyed all thoſe curſed things <hi>utterly,</hi> and then <hi>Senecherib</hi> may ſweare and curſe and rage, and blaſpheme; though it troubles the good King, (it is as a Sword in his bones to heare his <hi>GOD</hi> blaſphemed:)
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:110998:58"/> Yet I ſay in point of hurt and danger, to him or his City from without, the good King is careleſſe, becauſe there are no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations within.

               <p>Now whether <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did boaſt of the LORD, the giver of victories, all the day long, I cannot tell; he was an excellent Man, and yet but a Man, he might looke on his own arme too much, and on <hi>GODS Arme</hi> too little. Certaine it is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:110998:60"/> he gloried in his riches; it may be alſo, but that is one mans conjecture, <hi>he rejoyced</hi> too much at <hi>the destruction and lamentable end of his enemy.</hi> But this is cleare from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the Chapters, which we muſt obſerve here; <q>That our joyes doe not runne ſmooth and cleare away, there is a a mixture and mudd with them, and a <hi>ſettlement</hi> at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome; nor is our peace here below, a ſolid, continued, or an interrupted peace;</q> no, as our outward peace may be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: ſo our inward peace may be and is often ecclipſed. We muſt looke for changes here below; our comforts, as not <hi>full</hi> here, ſo nor permanent; we muſt looke for that in Heaven. Nay, commonly thus it is on earth; when our joyes here below are at the higheſt, yet there is a cloud above them, which, at that inſtant, that point of time, will overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow them: when we are at the heights in our joyes, then feare ſome depth of ſorrow; there is ſuch a connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, <hi>joyes</hi> and <hi>ſorrowes.</hi> So it ſeemes it was here with <hi>Hezekiah; In thoſe dayes;</hi> what dayes were thoſe? good and joyfull dayes, as we may imagine upon ſuch a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious victory as that was, and comming-in of Ambaſſadors to joy with him.

It is ſtrange, but ſo it is; That man can thinke of building Tabernacles upon his comforts here below, or upon any worldly thing, whereunto we give the Name of Glory, which hath ſo many waines and ecclipſes, how ſoone comes a cloud and overſhadowes all our glory! ſometimes when we are ſpeaking of ſetting up a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> I meane our <hi>reſt</hi> upon the creature, the cloud comes; that we may learne to expect changes here, and of ſorrowes too. An Enemy was even now at the Kings gate; no ſooner was he removed, but a ſickneſſe ſent unto him, which cut his heart like a Sword in his bowels. This trouble is blowne over, and now it is peace. Alas! mans peace here, is like a ſun-ſhine after raine, trouble as the cloud returnes againe.</p>
               <p>What is our expectation then?

Yet he is reckoned-up in this place, becauſe, when he comes to the buſineſſe, he ordered his <hi>Militia</hi> according to right reaſon and rule. Indeed we reade nothing of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> his <hi>Militia,</hi> before he was taken in the <hi>thornes, bound with fetters, and carried to</hi> Babilon, and brought <note place="margin">ver. 11, 12, 13.</note> againe thence to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for then <hi>he knew, that the LORD He was GOD.</hi> [See how the ſharpe thornes and bryars of affliction, can teach us, when the LORD is pleaſed to ſharpen and ſanctifie ſuch goades] But this is the leſſon; To admire the height and depth of GODS mercy; He ſuffers <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> to run-up to the height of all heatheniſh abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; to plunge himſelfe into a depth of innocent blood; and then, when he was neare the end of his race, the LORD recovers him, fetcheth him from out of that depth, and turnes his heart back againe. We muſt inſiſt upon this, that we may put the more obſervation upon it.</p>
               <p>¶ 1. <hi>The truth of</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>his Repentance, is cleared from the ſacred Text, not that there are any who doubt of it, but that none may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume from it. What takes off ſomewhat from the weight of his ſin, and adds to the terrour of an hypocriticall perſon, who doth one thing, and profeſſeth another: ſo</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>did not doe; and yet his ſins are heightned, ſo as to magnifie free grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OH the height of GODS merciel He lengthens out <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſehs</hi> day, and brings him into the <hi>Thorns</hi> towards night, that there he might bethink himſelfe of all his abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:110998:63"/> That we may admire free-grace, we muſt make a ſtand here, and looke upon <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> in the <hi>Thornes,</hi> and what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding mercy he found there: And I ſpeake of it here, that the proud ſinner may not preſume, nor the humble deſpaire; for a ſinner ſhall not be condemned, becauſe he is an old ſinner, and a great ſinner: but becauſe he is an impenitent ſinner: And ſuch an one <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was not, when he was in the <hi>Thornes. And when he was in affliction he beſought the LORD his</hi> GOD, <hi>and humbled himſelfe greatly before the</hi> God <hi>of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But may we thinke this Humiliation to be ſound? Yes, we <note place="margin">2 Chro. 33. 12.</note> dare not judge otherwiſe; nay, this Scripture aſſureth us, it was ſound: True it is, (and therefore I ſpeake of it in this place) when we are in the Thornes, when our ſorrows reach unto the heart, when our <hi>Month</hi> is come, and we are in our <note place="margin">Ier. 2.</note> pangs, then there will be pangs of ſorrow, whether after a <hi>godly ſort,</hi> or <hi>a worldly ſorrow unto Death,</hi> cannot poſſibly be diſcerned by the moſt diſcerning ſpirit, that dwells in fleſh, <hi>GOD</hi> knowes, Who only knowes the <hi>hearts of the children of Men;</hi> but there are ſome expreſſions in the Text, which are full of uſe to the Penitent and impenitent, both, clearing <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> his Repentance unto us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He beſought the</hi> LORD <hi>his</hi> GOD; ſo a wicked man may doe. <hi>He humbled himſelfe,</hi> ſo a wicked man may doe alſo: nay, <hi>greatly</hi> in mans judgement. Some might be pointed to, who, being in the <hi>Thornes,</hi> in great Agony of body and ſpirit both, expecting to make their appearance before the great Throne, have humbled themſelves greatly, given as great Teſtimony of true ſorrow, as poſſibly could be expreſſed; yet, being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the <hi>Thornes</hi> were worſe then ever before, Therefore, I ſay, <hi>greatly</hi> in mans judgment, ſo a wicked man may do too. <hi>But he humbled himſelfe GREATLY,</hi> before the LORD <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and as in GODS preſence, and by the Teſtimony of the Spirit, <hi>before the</hi> Lord <hi>condemning, judging, loathing himſelfe, accepting his puniſhment, greatly humbled before the</hi> Lord; ſo a wicked man cannot doe, none but a true Penitent. That againe, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>he prayed, and</hi> GOD <hi>was intreated of him.</hi> For a temporall Deliverance you will ſay; but We ſpeke of a ſoule mercy, of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:110998:64"/> an eternall redemption: And this me thinks may be concluded alſo, from the following vvords, Then <hi>Manaſſeh knew that the</hi> Lord <hi>He was</hi> God. All our evils, which are committed, are, as I may ſay, charged upon this one word, as their originall root, <hi>they knew not the</hi> Lord: So all our workes of righteouſnes upon this word, He <hi>knew the</hi> Lord; <hi>I</hi> cannot expreſſe the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that word, but it containes all: It is the ſumme of the Apoſtles Prayer, That the <hi>Lord</hi> would give the <hi>Epheſians</hi> the ſpirit of wiſdome and revelation in the <hi>KNOWLEDGE</hi> of Him <hi>[Eph.</hi> 1. 17.]</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, it do's not appeare, that <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the thornes, did returne unto folly, but the contrary will appeare anon, when we ſhall looke upon him, as a pattern of true Repentance.</p>
               <p>Now I will take leave, for the inſtruction of the living, to take ſo much from the weight of <hi>Manaſſehs</hi> ſinnes, and to put in ſo much allowance for it, as, I am confident, the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will allow me to doe: for <hi>GOD</hi> forbid I ſhould do more. And all this I ſhall doe for this great end, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the danger of <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> and to magnifie <hi>free-grace, Manaſſeh</hi> was an abominable Idolater profeſſedly ſo; but that was ſome helpe for him; he did not perſecute that way, he himſelfe walked-in; nor that Religion he ſeemed to profeſſe; he was indeed what he ſeemed to be, ſuch was he, and that I ſay was ſome helpe unto him. He offered his ſonne to <hi>Molech;</hi> he did it when he <hi>knew not the LORD.</hi> The Altars, his good Father threw downe, he ſet-up; but he did not ſet them up with his hand, and cry them downe with his mouth. Hee ſlew that Evangelicall <hi>Prophet Eſaiah;</hi> who ever was the Executioner, or what ever the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Death, <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> ſlew him: But <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> did not call them bloody Rebels, that killed <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as though they had done it againſt his mind and will. He ſhed <hi>innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jeruſalem from one end to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Kin. 21. 16.</note> But he did not, at that time, ſeeme to relent at what his hand did, and ſo water the ſame City at the ſame time with teares of fained compaſſion: I meane by this, he was not an hypocriticall King againſt whom that ſevere judgement is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:110998:64"/> as againſt an <hi>Hypocriticall Nation,</hi> and againſt <hi>the people of</hi> GODS <hi>wrath. Manaſſeh</hi> was not one manner of <note place="margin">Eſa. 10. 6.</note> man in ſhew and profeſſion; and another in deed and in truth. He did doe <hi>worſe then the Heathen,</hi> he was moſt abominable in all his wayes; But he was what he was, and he walked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his light in his owne wayes, which ſeemed right in his owne eyes. I thinke verily no man ever went further to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ruine, then <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> did, and returned in peace; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any plunged himſelfe deeper into the gulfe of ſinne, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped: But this is it I ſay; we cannot charge him with Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have ended the Story of <hi>Joſiah</hi> before I began it, for the dependance it had with that of his Father <hi>Amon,</hi> and his Grandfather <hi>Manaſſeh;</hi> And alſo becauſe, what hee did in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, is fully contained and runns <hi>paralell</hi> with that his great Grandfather did before him: onely ſome one or two expreſſions there are of great obſervation, which I ſhall obſerve anon. True it is, and well obſerved; As <hi>Amon</hi> his Father ſucceeded in the ſinnes of <hi>Manaſſeh's</hi> youth; ſo <hi>Joſiah</hi> his Grandchild ſucceeded in the virtues of his age. <hi>Joaſh</hi> began well, and ended ill; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> began ill and ended well; <hi>Joſiah</hi> began his reigne, and ended, never any King better. True it is alſo, never any did riſe to an higher pitch of holineſſe, and from a ſurer bottome, <note place="margin">2 Chron. 34 3.</note> (for he laid the foundation thereof in his young yeares) then <hi>Joſiah</hi> did; and never any more deſirous and zealous that way, to carry all with him to the ſame height; And for this he ſtands upon everlaſting record, to be the beſt King that ever
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:110998:69"/> was before him, and never the like after him, though we could ſpeake of one, who was a young King, and an old Saint.

               <p>TO make a collection of the whole Chronicle, I have in the former Section and Chapters traced the ſteps of the bad Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> tending in ſhew to the ſtrengthening them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Kingdome; but indeed and in the iſſue, to the ruine and deſtruction of all. Their irreligious Policies carried them hopefully-on ſometime, but confounded them and broke them to peeces at the laſt, for they would be wiſe with their owne counſells and ſtrong in their owne ſtrength, ſo they roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted-in that, which could not be rooted-out, till even <hi>Judah</hi> was rooted-out of the Land. So ſtrongly, as one ſaith, doth the painted vizour of wiſe proceedings delude even thoſe, that know the fowle face of imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ety lurking under it: But behold the wretched ends, that have ever followed it, whereof the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> firſt mentioned, were themſelves very great examples, and ſo they are propounded to following generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, holding forth in their example <hi>DEATH</hi> and <hi>EVILL</hi> before Kings and people.</p>
               <p>But now here is the wonder, that the wicked have not yet learnt, after ſo many thouſand yeares experience, That they worke a deceitfull worke, that they pull downe wrath upon their owne heads, and that the <hi>Politicians</hi> beaten wayes tend to death. They march-on as furiouſly now as ever they did: but I forbeare.</p>
               <p>In the latter <hi>Section</hi> and fore-going Chapters, I have traced the ſtepps of the good Kings, and we have found them wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſtrait-on towards thoſe two great ends, the <hi>glory of GOD,</hi> and <hi>the ſafety of their Kingdome,</hi> carrying all levell thereunto; for their counſell was taken from GODS mouth, and their ſtrength from His right Arme: They <hi>SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED-out what Idolaters had done</hi> to provoke the <hi>LORD</hi> to <hi>Anger,</hi> and tooke it away. All their care was to make their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:110998:72"/> Kingdome the LORDS Kingdome; and their Land the <hi>Lords</hi> Land. I need not adde, <hi>And they prospered;</hi> but I will adde, <hi>So they prospered, as that they were the wonder of the world,</hi> and <hi>The feare of them fell upon the Nations.</hi> And ſo theſe hold forth to after Generations, <hi>Life, Good,</hi> and <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</hi> We might wonder here alſo, how any ſhould forſake <hi>this good way,</hi> and chooſe a way of their owne, but the heart is deepe, and the deceit there cannot be bottom'd, and there are depths of Satan, and wee are not ignorant of his wiles, how ready and able he is to ſeduce, and how willing the heart is to follow, though to deſtruction; but I forbeare here alſo.</p>
               <p>From theſe two ſo different wayes, the bad and good Kings have walked in, we will conclude what way muſt be taken well to <hi>Poſture a Kingdome,</hi> for that is our maine ſcope of all that is ſaid: And firſt I will put it down negatively.</p>
               <p>Not a <hi>Magazine</hi> of treaſures; nor an <hi>Arſenall</hi> of Armour, nor a <hi>Fleet</hi> by Sea, nor <hi>Forces</hi> by Land; nor <hi>Towers, Walls, Barrs,</hi> none of all this can ſecure a Kingdome, nor put it into a <hi>Poſture of Defence;</hi> for then <hi>Babylon,</hi> that great City, had ſtood it out to this day, which had a mighty River, a wall of water to ſecure it, and indeed thereby the King was ſo ſecured in his ſafety, That he was drinking wine in bowles, when part of his <hi>City was taken;</hi> and the Sword in his bowels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">a I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Then it will be ſaid, what need of wals, towers, gates and bars? Yes great need; for though the ſafety of a City doth not conſiſt in having walls and gates, and bars about it, but in the ſafeguard of the Almighty, and His ſhutting in the gates, as He did the doors of the Arke: yet the City will not neglect her walls and gates or leave them open; for this were to tempt GOD, and to forfeit His protection: We muſt not write Salvation upon any <note place="margin">1 King. 7. 2.</note> viſible fortifications, how mighty and ſtrong ſoever; we muſt not truſt to them. But ſuch is the fooliſh pride of mans heart, he can glory in his owne ſtrength, and magnifie his own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, courage, fore-ſight, and forget <hi>God</hi> the Maker, and giver of all things. Whence it comes to paſſe, that the ſtronger he finds himſelfe, the more he turns from <hi>God,</hi> and fals before his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, at ſuch a time when he thought it moſt impoſſible. The walls then may be too high; the Caſtles too ſtrong; the people too many for GOD to defend a people, or to give them the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, becauſe of the curſed pride of mans heart, who will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe ſalvation to the ſtrength of his Mountaine (which GOD
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:110998:73"/> made ſo ſtrong) and can quickly weaken, if Man will not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up to Him, off from himſelfe, and give <hi>GOD</hi> the Glory. In Him the <hi>fatherleſſe find mercy,</hi> they that put no confidence in the <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 3.</note> Arme of fleſh.</p>
               <p>A people then may look to their <hi>Militia</hi> and uſe all meanes to fortifie themſelves with walls and <hi>brazen barrs,</hi> but they muſt have reſpect to Him, Who ſtrengthneth the <hi>barrs of his gates.</hi>

                  <hi>perplexity,</hi> they did <hi>look</hi> to the <hi>armour</hi> of that <hi>houſe</hi> (though they <note place="margin">Eſa. 22. 5, 8.</note> ſhould have looked to it ſooner, and how provided they were of ſtore and proviſion there:) Nor are they blamed for beholding the breaches of the City, which were many, and looking to all means to ſtop the ſame, and to fortifie themſelves: All this was conſiderable, had they done it ſooner. But for this they are bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and ſtand deeply charged of folly, that they looked to the <hi>Armour</hi> of the <hi>houſe,</hi> and how they might fortifie the wall, and <note place="margin">ver. 11.</note> make a ditch; but did not looke <hi>unto the Maker thereof, neither had respect to Him, that faſhioned it long agoe.</hi> So then we may look to our <hi>Armories,</hi> and to all means of Fortification, but ſo as we looke ſtedfaſtly to the maker thereof; for we can tell now, what the <hi>Militia</hi> is, not an Arme of fleſh, neither Chariots nor horſe-men, vain things <hi>to ſave a man:</hi> It matters not how high <note place="margin">

               <p>2. This, I ſay, for I will not recall that which went before <note n="a" place="margin">Pſa. 68. 17.</note>,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:110998:74"/> is the <hi>Militia</hi> of a Kingdome; <hi>GOD</hi> with <hi>His twenty thouſand Chariots, even thouſands of Angels, the</hi> Lord <hi>among His people, as</hi>

                  <hi>in the Holy place:</hi> for He, That is, <hi>Iſraels</hi> God, is the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and unto this <hi>God</hi> the <hi>LORD</hi> belongs <hi>the iſſues from Death.</hi> Therefore it was, that all the good Kings and Princes, took this one way to ſecure then Kingdome; they and their people <hi>AS. SOCIATED</hi> themſelves (that was their next worke after the <hi>Abominations</hi> were <hi>spied out</hi> and removed) came up to <hi>God,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his Termes, joyned themſelves in <hi>Covenant</hi> with Him, therby ſhrewded themſelvs and their people, under the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> that <hi>His Salvation</hi> might be round about them, &amp; their people for Wals and Bulwarks: As this was their deſigne; ſo this one way they tooke to bring their deſigne about (it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſpoken too often) they <hi>ſpied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>out</hi> what Idolaters had done to provoke the eyes of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and all that they removed: then they <hi>aſſociated</hi> themſelvs, came up to GOD to bind themſelvs to Him in the bond of a <hi>Covenant.</hi> This is the old way, which good men have troden, direct and ſtrait forward in a conformity to the rule, and driving-on theſe great ends; <hi>The glory of</hi> God <hi>and the good of His people.</hi> And it is one and the ſame way, and varieth not; It is the <hi>way</hi> of the wicked, that has turnings and windings in it, for they, as the crooked <hi>Scrpent</hi> their leader, and like harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Beaſts, do love <hi>confuſa veſtigia:</hi> But I ſay, the way of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous is one and the ſame ſtra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>-forward. And it is obſervable, though it could be no otherwiſe, That theſe good Kings, went all one way, minded one thing, carried all levell to one mark: all made the ſame beginning, the ſame progreſſe, attained the ſame <hi>end, Sabbath</hi> and <hi>Port</hi> of their labours, their owne and their Kingdoms peace here, and everlaſting Peace in a Kingdome, which has a <hi>foundation,</hi> and ſhall never be ſhaken.</p>
               <p>A man would wonder now, That this way) ſo beaten out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us by the foot-ſteps of the godly, ſo direct, ſo plaine away, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>the foole cannot erre</hi> (i. e.) he that has ceaſed from his owne wiſdome) a way of pleaſantneſſe and of peace; a way, which <hi>GOD</hi> has be ſtrewed all along with bleſſings; and wherin His foot-ſteps have dropped fatnes: A wonder I ſay, that this way ſhould be miſtaken. And yet no wonder, when wee conſider againe, that (it is ſaid) the <hi>foole</hi> ſhall not erre in it, but
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:110998:74"/> the wiſe-man ſhall not find it, who is his owne guide and truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his owne wiſdome.</p>
               <p>And now we can diſcerne the reaſon, whence it comes to paſſe, That, though there be but one way, one maine and chiefe end (the other but ſubordinate and ſecundary;) all the motions to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That there is but <hi>one Houſe of Parliament:</hi> pride and ambition, and I know not what, have made them two, and ſeperated them, whom <hi>God</hi> had joyned at the firſt, and made one, if the Records of time tell true, and I have read what they ſay. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we allow heartily a diſtinction in perſons and places, though yet, as <hi>God</hi> hath made them, let them be, and be ſo called, no longer two, but one Houſe, for ſo anciently it was. But if there be a diſtinction in point of office and ſervice, then the ſcale turnes towards the lower Houſe, for there one man ſtands for ten thouſand, a great engagement to his ſervice.
